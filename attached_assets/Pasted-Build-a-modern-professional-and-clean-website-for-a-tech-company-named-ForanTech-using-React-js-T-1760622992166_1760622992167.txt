Build a modern, professional, and clean website for a tech company named ForanTech using React.js. The design should be aesthetic, well-structured, and responsive. Use a classic, minimal color palette — not too bright and not too dark (for example, a balance of white, charcoal gray, deep blue, and accent teal). The overall look should be sleek, professional, and futuristic, suitable for a technology company. ⸻ 🔝 Header • Include the ForanTech logo on the left. • Navigation buttons on the right: Home, Blog, About Us, Contact. • The header should be fixed on scroll with a subtle background blur or fade animation. ⸻ 🦸 Hero Section • Full-width background video (tech or innovation-related). • Centered slogan line such as: “Innovating the Future with Technology.” • Below the slogan, add a primary CTA button like “Contact Us” or “Let’s Connect.” • Text and button should animate smoothly on load (fade-up or slide-in). ⸻ ⚙️ Our Services Section • On scroll down, the section first shows a full-page title: “Our Services” with a GSAP scroll animation that makes the title slide to the left as the user scrolls. • As the title moves, service cards should appear one by one in a stacked, animated layout (use GSAP or Framer Motion). • Each service card should have: • A front side with the service title. • On hover, the card rotates 360° to reveal a short description on the back. • When scrolling up, the reverse animation should happen (services hide, title expands to full page). • Keep animations smooth and performance-optimized. ⸻ 📰 Blog Section • Simple and clean layout — a grid of blog cards with thumbnail, title, short description, and “Read More” link. • Add a subtle hover effect that highlights or slightly elevates the blog card. • No heavy animations here, just elegant interactivity. ⸻ 👥 About Us Section • Professional and visually engaging design. • Include: • A short description of ForanTech and what it does: “ForanTech is a forward-thinking technology company specializing in innovative software, digital solutions, and cutting-edge tech products to empower businesses and individuals.” • A section showcasing core values, mission statement, and expertise areas (e.g., AI solutions, web development, automation). • Use subtle scroll animations or reveal effects for content blocks. • Add relevant tech or innovation-themed illustrations or diagrams to make it engaging. ⸻ 📞 Contact Us Section • Left side: Contact form with the following fields: • Name • Email • Phone • Country (dropdown list) • Service Interest (dropdown for selecting which service they want) • Right side: A tech-themed diagram or illustration (matching ForanTech’s field). • Keep the form neatly styled with rounded inputs and a professional submit button. ⸻ ⚫ Footer • Simple footer with: • “© ForanTech. All rights reserved.” • Social media icons/links (LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Instagram, etc.). • Optional quick navigation links. • Use a smooth dark background with light text for contrast. ⸻ ⚙️ Technical & Design Notes • Use React.js with smooth GSAP or Framer Motion animations. • The layout must be fully responsive (desktop, tablet, and mobile). • Keep consistent typography — use a professional sans-serif font like Poppins or Inter. • Maintain good whitespace and alignment to ensure a clean UI. • Include reusable React components for header, footer, and sections. • Code should be clean, semantic, and production-ready. ⸻ Goal: Deliver a visually appealing, animation-rich, professional website that reflects innovation and technological excellence for ForanTech.
